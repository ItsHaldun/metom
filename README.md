# METOM
**M**LOps for **E**nd-to-end **T**raining of **O**nline **M**odels

## Setup
Just run the setup.sh script. You should be inside the project root while doing so.
It will install Pipx, Poetry and Pyenv, and setup the Poetry environment.
Note that Pipx requires Python3.8 or later to be installed along with pip package manager.

```console
# Linux
chmod +x /path/to/setup.sh
/path/to/setup.sh
```


## TODO

- [ ] Expand installation to Mac and Windows
- [ ] Add guides for poetry and pyenv?
- [ ] Write the script that'll run the actual machine learning training (train.sh)
